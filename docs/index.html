<h1><a name="Imperial">Imperial</a></h1>

<p>is a library for streamlining the editing and creation process for ROMs. Making or adjusting to different tools for different systems can be tedious, and sometimes a headache to even find tools for obscure systems. Perhaps you want to edit a game's levels, but want a simple framework to do it with rather than writing a tool from scratch. Maybe you make original games, and you need something to convert your resources as well as your code.</p>

<p>These things are what this project aspires to streamline. Frankly, hacking is a huge pain in the ass. It's more of a mastery of adaption to your interfacing rather than the systems themselves. I want to do anything I can to make that easier, for myself mainly. Therefore, eventually, Imperial will become a suite of tools to this effect. For this list of hopes and dreams, see the <a href="./Architecture/Tools">tool designs</a> section.</p>

<p>The system strives for being the be all and end all of binary conversion and modification. It can easily support things besides ROMs, even if that's its focus.</p>
